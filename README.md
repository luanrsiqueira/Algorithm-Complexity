# Algorithm-Complexity
Empirical analysis of the algorithmic complexity of bioinformatics tools

# Skills
- PYTHON
- IPYTHON
- R

# How to use
1. First you install the tools in the same folder
2. Change the appropriate PATH in the script
3. Using the terminal, use the command: 'measuring_time.py -i PATH <Parired tag 1> -p PATH <Paired tag 2> -f PATH <Input list.txt for FastUniq>'

you can use the data_manipulation.ipynb script to plot the data.
After an initial ordering, you can use the script
empirical_analysis.Rmd to determine the tool's algorithmic complexity for certain data sets.

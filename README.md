# Algorithm-Complexity
Empirical analysis of the algorithmic complexity of bioinformatics tools

# Skills
- PYTHON
- IPYTHON
- R

# How to use
1. First you install the tools in the same folder

2. Change the appropriate PATH in the script

3. Using the terminal, use the command: 'measuring_time.py -i PATH <Parired tag 1> -p PATH <Paired tag 2> -f PATH <Input list.txt for FastUniq>'

4. You can use the data_manipulation.ipynb script to plot the data

5. After an initial ordering, you can use the script empirical_analysis.Rmd to determine the tool's algorithmic complexity for certain data sets
